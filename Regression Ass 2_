    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?  \n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a key metric in linear regression models. It measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%):\n",

    "0: The model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1: The model explains all the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 0 and 1: The model explains some, but not all, of the variability.\n",

    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "             R2=1− (SSres/SStot)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Comparing Models with Different Numbers of Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have multiple models with different numbers of predictors, adjusted R-squared helps you determine which model provides a better fit. Unlike regular R-squared, it penalizes the addition of unnecessary predictors, ensuring that only significant predictors improve the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoiding Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In models with many predictors, regular R-squared can be misleadingly high due to overfitting. Adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of predictors, providing a more realistic measure of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing feature selection or model selection processes, adjusted R-squared helps identify the model that balances complexity and explanatory power. It ensures that adding more predictors only improves the model if they contribute significantly to explaining the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluating Model Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add new predictors to a model, adjusted R-squared helps you evaluate whether these new predictors genuinely improve the model or just inflate the R-squared value artificially."

    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection Bias (Lasso)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Sensitivity to Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized linear models are sensitive to the scale of the features. Features with larger scales can dominate the penalty term, leading to biased coefficient estimates. Proper feature scaling (e.g., standardization) is essential before applying these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity in Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate regularization parameter ((\\lambda)) is crucial for model performance. This often requires extensive cross-validation, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interpretability\n",

    "\n",
    "2. High-Dimensional Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations (high-dimensional data), regularized linear models may struggle. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimensionality reduction methods might be more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complex Interactions\n",
